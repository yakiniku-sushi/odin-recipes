    <ol>
        <li>Wash and soak the rice. Then cook it for about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, put about 200ml of vinegar at a pan,
            sugar at taste, a pinch of salt, 2 table spoon of mirin or sake,
            and heat until sugar melts and the vinegar evaporets for some time
            without letting it boil(more or less sour)
        </li>
        <li>After the rice is coocked and the vinegar sauce is ready, put them
            at a recipient and mix them until the rice is hydrated (not too wet)
        </li>
        <li>Cut the fish in stripes as long as nori sheets</li>
        <li>Put the nori sheets on the sushi mat with the wrinkled side up</li>
        <li>After the rice had cooled down, get a small portion, enough to fill the nori sheet
            with a layer of rice, leaving about 1 cm rice-free at top</li>
        <li>Put the sliced fish(or any other filling) in the middle, and wrap using the sushi mat.</li>
        <li>Seal the sushi with some water on the rice-free top side</li>
    </ol>
